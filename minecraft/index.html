    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
    <h3><ol>

            <br><ul><li><strong>minecraft.anture.us</strong></li></ul><br>

        </li>
        
        <li>Why?</li>
            <ul><li>Because who doesnt wanna play minecraft together and create a real glaggleland on any platform?</li></ul>
            <ul><li>I love minecraft, I hate playing it by myself. Couple of years ago I had a series of servers me and my friends played on and they seemed to have a lot of fun. And if you havent become part of a server before it can be a lot of fun just logging in everyday and enjoying playing with real people live</li></ul><br>
        <li>Where does my data goðŸ˜¥</li>
            <ul><li>If you are asking about your ip address, just into the logs. It's a minecraft server, the only way you can join the server is by giving your ip address so you can connect, if you go to google.com thats it does the same thing its just how the internet works. However we withhold our standard of protecting our users privacy and your ip address will never leave the VM inside the server, not even for me or anyone else. It's just our rule</li></ul><br>
        <li>How does this work????</li>
            <ul><li>Check out <a href="https://geysermc.org/">geysermc</a></li></ul><br>
        <li>Why is so vanilla why is no home why :sad_spoingbob:</li>
            <ul><li>Well the server was inspired by another called Standard Survival (sure thats a ad for them idc) but you should learn to appreciate the game and play it normally. It comes with just the basic factions and in person trading/money</li></ul><br>
        <li>It's not finishedðŸ˜¥</li>
            <ul><li>Mental Health, plus timing, plus im doing this for free so we can have fun stfu</li></ul><br>
        <li>How do I?</li>
            <ul><li>/faction create to create I think it's /faction help for more info.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>/trade {playername} to trade with someone, but you need to be standing right next to them</li></ul>
            <ul><li>/exchange to open the menu to trade diamonds to money. Currently 1 is 300 but you cant extract from this</li></ul>
            <ul><li>/currency pay pays a player remotley /currency balance shows your balance</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Im adding a way to see the current value of the server and leaderboards soon</li></ul>
        <br><li>Problems? Reports? Dm a Funny Fish officer on the discord server (at the bottom of the page or <a href="/cheeb/discord/">here</a></li><br>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h3><ol>
        <li>Keep it civil, treat others how you want to be treated, don't use slurs or be bigot. anarchy</li><br>
        <li>Don't hack bro like common, optifine and the soon to be officail companion modpack are aceptable, no modified clients or hack clients, or anything to gain advantage against other players.</li><br>
        <li>Don't kill and harass new players, they are trying to have fun. I'll have other ways to determin this. Give them at least a hour after they join. There should hopefully be a time played amount in the score board (tab menu) or another method soon.
        </li><br>
        <li>It does have a factions plugin, but lets just try and keep it fun for everyone it's not supposed to be a warzone lol.</li><br>
        <li>Dont exploit any part of the game before it has been fixed or tell anyone other than the mods. Like thats just not fair and a advantage against everyone else</li><br>
        <li>Anything else I haven't included in here yet.</li>
    </ol></h3>
